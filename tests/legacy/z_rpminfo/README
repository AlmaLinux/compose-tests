Adding an rpminfo check override for a package can be done in 2 ways:
- Modifying required_attrs in check-rpminfo.py
  - should be done for packages specified by name (i.e. overrides for _all_ versions of that package)
- Adding an NVR line in special_overrides.txt
  - should be done for specific NVRs
  - in the form: <name>-<version>-<release>: <attrib_to_override> 

Adding an attribute to check:
- modify the required_attrs dict in check-rpminfo.py
  - the key is the name of the attribute to check
  - the value is a shell-style glob of what the attribute should be
